# Python basics library
This repository contains the essence of what I have learned about Python and how to use it. Through course, but also from my self study practices, and probably future exiting developments and experiences, this repository will grow in memory.

I will do my best to conduct this repository in mainly english, however some instances in polish, as it is my mothers tounge, might appear.

My coding skills are best represented in the Practice files in every diretory, depending on the topic, or with more intertwined tasks, these will be in separate directory.
The notes files are full of comments, which are there so I could find that I am looking for, certain usage of code, tricks or patterns, which if I won't use as frequently, I might not notice at very first glance.

## Topics and their completeness (at least for now)

- [x] Basic syntax, input, data types and conversion 
- [x] Conditional instructions and building functions
- [x] Working with strings, str operations and formatting
- [x] Basic data structures (list, set, tuple, dictionary)
- [x] Infinite and finite loops
- [x] Testing errors and code testing
- [x] Modules and creating modules
- [x] Object oriented programmings
- [x] Decorators and packing arguments
- [x] Handling files in Python

That's it for now. Hope this repository will grow overtime and handle many useful tricks.
