# Modules
A module is a file containing code we want to include in our program.
These can be already existing Python modules or our files in which we create
functions and constants needed for our program.

## Importing a module
There are main two ways to get the additional functions and constants from a module,
no matter if it is our module or built-in module.
```python
import math #one of the way, which imports all funtions
#OR
from math import function1, function2 
#this is a more optimal way, since it uses less memory, but can be tricky
#if we use not intentionally the same name for something in our code and overwrite the module value/function
```
If by mistake we overwrite a value or function it of course it won't affect the code in the module.

## Creating a module
Creating a new module or modules, or creating them specially for a project
is very common. It saves on some memory and makes the code easier to read.

To create a new module, we need to create a new file or a Python package.
Then, in the file, we write our functions or constants. Good practice is 
to not use any other modules in our module - if we import our module which includes
a different module, we need to import that module to our project as well -
otherwise our module won't work correctly.

## Python modules
To check on all available Python modules, we can use `print(help('modules'))`.
This will print all the available modules and then if we want to know more 
about specific module, it's best to to type `print(help('module_name))` and all
the available functions and variables will be explained.

Some of the most important modules for Data Science would include:

**statistics** - this module provides functions for calculating mathematical statistics of numeric data

**csv** - this module implements classes to read and write tabular data 
in CSV format. It allows programmers to say, “write this data in the format 
preferred by Excel,” or “read data from this file which was generated by 
Excel,” without knowing the precise details of the CSV format used by Excel.

**datetime** - this module supplies classes for manipulating dates and times.
While date and time arithmetic is supported, the focus of the implementation 
is on efficient attribute extraction for output formatting and manipulation.

**math** - this module provides access to the mathematical functions defined by the C standard.

**random** - this module implements pseudo-random number generators for 
various distributions. [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html), [W3School](https://www.w3schools.com/python/module_random.asp), [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-random-module/), [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piJc18hcH0Y).

**re** - also know as *regular expressions*. This module provides regular 
expression matching operations. This allows us to search or filter the information
as we desire. [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html), [Google](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/regular-expressions), [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnuBwl2ekmo),

**time** - module provides various time-related functions. For related 
functionality, see also the datetime and calendar modules.
[Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html), [Programiz](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/time), [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj3GlL5ckQA).

**unittest** - this is unit testing framework was originally inspired by 
JUnit and has a similar flavor as major unit testing frameworks in other 
languages. [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html), [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-unittest-to-write-a-test-case-for-a-function-in-python), [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL0opWf3DeM).

**itertools** - this module standardizes a core set of fast, memory 
efficient tools that are useful by themselves or in combination.
