# Task 1
# Create a function called add_contacts, which will intake following arguments:
#   - dictionary with contacts
#   - key name
#   - phone number (string).
# If the contact is in the dictionary, return that it already exists;
# If the contact is not in the dictionary, add it and confirm that.
# The function does not return anything.

# Task 2
# Given the dictionary "data", create a new dictionary from these tuples where:
#   key = first value
#   value = second value / 50
# Program should skip all the duplicates.

# Task 3
# Write a function named manage_list, which intakes two arguments:
#     - command: add and delete;
#     - value
# If add is used, we add the value to the list, and if it's delete, it should
# be deleted using pop().
# The function does not return anything
